            <p class="text">The seven wonders of the world are magnificent structures that inspire a sense of wonder. The seven wonders of the classical world astonished those that have the opportunity to have seen them in history. The New Seven Wonders Foundation in Switzerland did receive over 200 entries from all over the world, and twenty-one contestants were chosen. In Lisbon, Portugal, the complete list of the seven modern wonders was declared in 2007. The Taj Mahal of India, China Great Wall, Brazil  Christ the Redeemer statue, Peru  Machu Picchu, Jordan Petra, Italy Colosseum, and Mexico Chichen Itza make up the latest seven modern wonders of the world</p>

                <h2 class="desc">Great Wall</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">The Great Wall of China is a chain of fortifications constructed of stone, brick, compressed earth, wooden, and other resources that run east-west across China  historical northern borders to protect Chinese states and empires against assaults and invasions by various nomadic peoples from the Eurasian Steppe.
                Border restrictions, allowing the application of tariffs on products conveyed along the Silk Route, trade restrictions and stimulation, and high migration controls are among the other uses of the Great Wall in China.
                <br/><br/>
                Constructed over centuries by countless labourers, this architectural marvel stands as a symbol of the Chinese Empire's determination to protect its borders and preserve its cultural heritage. Stretching for thousands of miles, the Great Wall is not a single, continuous structure, but rather a complex network of walls, watchtowers, and fortresses.

                <br/><br/>
                Originally known as the Flavian Amphitheater, the Colosseum was a marvel of engineering and architecture. Its elliptical structure, measuring 620 feet by 513 feet, could accommodate a staggering 50,000 to 80,000 spectators.

                <h2 class="desc">Machu Picchu</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Machu Picchu can be built in a “15th century” Inca stronghold perched on a mountain crest 2,430 metres (7,970 feet) above sea level. It is situated above the Scenic Landscape, 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Cuzco and from which the Urubamba River runs in Peru Peru Cusco Region, Urubamba Province Machu Picchu Area. Most Machu Picchu, around 140 buildings, were made of granite, so their ruins blend nicely with the surrounding mountains. Regular granite blocks were fitted so closely collectively (without adhesive) that a knife could not fit between the stones in several spots.
                <br/><br/>
                The precise purpose of Machu Picchu remains shrouded in mystery, though theories abound. Some scholars believe it served as a royal estate or sacred religious site for Inca leaders, while others propose it was a retreat for Inca nobility or a centre for astronomical observations.

                <h2 class="desc">Chichen Itza</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Chichen Itza is a magnificent monument with incredible architectural and historical significance, but it also contains proof that the Mayans were well ahead of their time in Mexico. Researchers have given the building the name Chichen Itza Structure 5B18. While most people are aware that Chichen Itza was created by the Mayans thousands of years ago, there are several features that visitors are unaware of. Chichen Itza’s name refers to an archaeological site rather than the most popular tourist feature, a pyramid.
                <br/><br/>
                Among the most iconic landmarks are the El Castillo Pyramid, a massive step pyramid that served as a testament to the Mayans' advanced understanding of astronomy, and the Temple of the Warriors, a grand structure adorned with columns and carvings that depict Mayan deities and warriors, and the Great Ball Court, the largest and most impressive of its kind in the Mayan world, where ritualistic ball games were played.

                <h2 class="desc">Petra</h2>

They were skilled traders and engineers, and Petra became their capital city, flourishing from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. Its strategic location along the ancient Silk Road made it a vital hub for trade between Arabia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean world.
